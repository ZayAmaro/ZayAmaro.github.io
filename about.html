        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Zay Amaro, and this blog is a space where I explore what it
            means to live out Christian faith in everyday life. My experiences in
            sports, discipline, and personal growth have shaped how I view faith
            beyond traditional settings.

        <h2>Why This Blog Exists</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Faith Beyond the Field</strong> is about applying faith outside
            of church walls—on the field, in the gym, at work, and in daily decisions.
            Through reflection and conversation, this blog aims to encourage others
            to live intentionally and faithfully in all areas of life.
